                            </p>
                            <p>Part One Chapter I</p>
                            <p>Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom
                                realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton
                                twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the
                                delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of
                                French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish
                                father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
                                square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch
                                of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and
                                slightly tilted at the ends.</p>
                            <p>Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward,
                                cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white
                                skin-- <span id="sks-a1">that skin so prized by Southern
                                    women</span>and so carefully guarded with bonnets,
                                veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with
                                Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the
                                porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright
                                April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture.</p>

                        <div id="page2" class="int-pp-passagePage">
                            <p>Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its
                                twelve yards of billowing material over herhoops and
                                exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers
                                her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The
                                dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist,
                                the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting
                                basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen
                                years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts,
                                the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon
                                and the quietness of small white hands folded in her
                                lap, <span id="sks2">her true self was poorly
                                    concealed.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were
                                turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at
                                variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had
                                been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle
                                admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy;
                                her eyes were her own.</p>

                            <p>On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in
                                their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall
                                mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked,
                                their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with
                                saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years
                                old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of
                                muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their
                                eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in
                                identical <span id="sks-a3">blue coats and mustard-colored
                                    breeches,</span> were as much alike as two bolls of
                                cotton.</p>
                            <p>Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the
                                yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood
                                trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against
                                the background of new green. The twins' horses were
                                hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their
                                masters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled
                                the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that
                                accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay a
                                black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently
                                waiting for the boys to go home to supper. Between the
                                hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship
                                deeper than that of their constant companionship. 
                                <span id="sks4">They were all healthy, thoughtless
                                    young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys
                                    as mettlesome as the horses they rode, mettlesome and
                                    dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew
                                    how to handle them.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>Although born to the ease of plantation life, waited
                                on hand and foot since infancy, the faces of the three
                                on the porch were neither slack nor soft. They had the
                                vigor and alertness of country people who have spent
                                all their lives in the open and troubled their heads
                                very little with dull things in books. Life in the
                                north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and,
                                according to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and
                                Charleston, a little crude. The more sedate and older
                                sections of the South looked down their noses at the
                                up-country</p>
