                                    <html5:p>Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom
                                        realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton
                                        twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the
                                        delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of
                                        French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish
                                        father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
                                        square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch
                                        of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and
                                        slightly tilted at the ends.</html5:p>
                                    <html5:p>Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward,
                                        cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white
                                        skin-- that skin so prized by Southern
                                        women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,
                                        veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with
                                        Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the
                                        porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright
                                        April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture.</html5:p>
                                </html5:div>

                                    <html5:p>Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its
                                    twelve yards of billowing material over herhoops and
                                    exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers
                                    her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The
                                    dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist,
                                    the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting
                                    basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen
                                    years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts,
                                    the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon
                                    and the quietness of small white hands folded in her
                                    lap, her true self was poorly
                                    concealed.</html5:p>
                                <html5:p>The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were
                                    turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at
                                    variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had
                                    been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle
                                    admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy;
                                    her eyes were her own.</html5:p>

                                    mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked,
                                    their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with
                                    saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years
                                    old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of
                                    muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their
                                    eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in

                                    breeches, were as much alike as two bolls of

                                    yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood
                                    trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against
                                    the background of new green. The twins' horses were
                                    hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their
                                    masters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled
                                    the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that
                                    accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went.</html5:p>

                                    waiting for the boys to go home to supper. Between the
                                    hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship
                                    deeper than that of their constant companionship. 
                                    They were all healthy, thoughtless
                                    young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys

                                    dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew

                                    on hand and foot since infancy, the faces of the three
                                    on the porch were neither slack nor soft. They had the
                                    vigor and alertness of country people who have spent
                                    all their lives in the open and troubled their heads
                                    very little with dull things in books. Life in the

                                    Charleston, a little crude. The more sedate and older

                                <html5:p>Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward,
                                    cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white
                                    skin--that skin so prized by Southern
                                    women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,
                                    veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with
                                    Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the
                                    porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright
                                    April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture.</html5:p>
                                <html5:p>Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its
                                    twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and
                                    exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers
                                    her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The
                                    dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist,
                                    the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting
                                    basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen
                                    years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts,
                                    the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon
                                    and the quietness of small white hands folded in her
                                    lap,her true self was poorly concealed.

                                <html5:p>Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom
                                    realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton
                                    twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the
                                    delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of
                                    French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish
                                    father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
                                    square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch
                                    of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and
                                    slightly tilted at the ends.</html5:p>
