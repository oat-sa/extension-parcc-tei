                                    <p>Part One Chapter I</p>
                                    <p>Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom
                                        realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton
                                        twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the
                                        delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of
                                        French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish
                                        father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
                                        square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch
                                        of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and
                                        slightly tilted at the ends.</p>
                                    <p>Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward,
                                        cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white
                                        skin-- that skin so prized by Southern
                                        women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,
                                        veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns. Seated with
                                        Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the
                                        porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright
                                        April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture.</p>

                                    <p>Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its
                                        twelve yards of billowing material over herhoops and
                                        exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers
                                        her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The
                                        dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist,
                                        the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting
                                        basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen
                                        years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts,
                                        the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon
                                        and the quietness of small white hands folded in her
                                        lap, her true self was poorly
                                        concealed.</p>
                                    <p>The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were
                                        turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at
                                        variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had
                                        been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle
                                        admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy;
                                        her eyes were her own.</p>

                                        mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked,
                                        their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with
                                        saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years
                                        old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of
                                        muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their
                                        eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in
                                        identical blue coats and mustard-colored
                                        breeches, were as much alike as two bolls of

                                        yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood
                                        trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against
                                        the background of new green. The twins' horses were
                                        hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their
                                        masters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled
                                        the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that
                                        accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went.</p>

                                    <p>A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay a
                                        black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently
                                        waiting for the boys to go home to supper. Between the
                                        hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship
                                        deeper than that of their constant companionship. 
                                        They were all healthy, thoughtless
                                        young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys
                                        as mettlesome as the horses they rode, mettlesome and
                                        dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew
                                        how to handle them.</p>
                                    <p>Although born to the ease of plantation life, waited
                                        on hand and foot since infancy, the faces of the three
                                        on the porch were neither slack nor soft. They had the
                                        vigor and alertness of country people who have spent
                                        all their lives in the open and troubled their heads
                                        very little with dull things in books. Life in the
                                        north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and,
                                        according to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and
                                        Charleston, a little crude. The more sedate and older
                                        sections of the South looked down their noses at the

                                father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
                                square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch
                                of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and

                                her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The
                                dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist,
                                the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting
                                basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen

                                the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon
                                and the quietness of small white hands folded in her
                                lap,her true self was poorly concealed.
